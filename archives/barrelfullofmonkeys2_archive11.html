        <h1>THE END?</h1>
        <p> Hey Thanks for reading!
        <br>Eventually I would like to continue this series.
        <br>I have two more sequels in mind.
        <br>But honestly I'm not very happy with how long 
        <br>this took for me to finish.  And obviously
        <br>I'm a little worried about how similar this project
        <br>is to "WandaVision" even though I wrote this And
        <br>drew the first issue YEARS ago.  It's just parallel
        <br>thinking as I'm hardly the first person to come up
        <br>with this premise but if any evil waiters show up
        <br>in that show I am SUING!  
        <br>keep checking back though!  I have some pretty
        <br>fun projects on the horizon, and I plan on posting 
        <br>pages a lot more quickly.  Again thanks a lot for 
        <br>sticking with me on this.  All for my fan(s)! 
        </p>
