    <h1>PILEDRIVER BLOG! </h1> 
   
      
    <p>So, I've spent the last few years working on a Webtoon called:
       <br>"Dan in Dreamland"   
      <br>Nobody really read it, which is unsurprising since it was a
      <br>fantasy adventure for kids and that site seems to be more for romance.
     <br>I really love and believe in that story so I will post it here
    <br>and will hopefully be returning to it soon.
<br> HOW FUCKING EVER...I am super fucking pissed at this election
<br>and the state of the world and what this fucking neo-puritanical
<br>alt-right lunacy has done to my family and friends.
<br>So I hope you like the dark shit.  Cause it's about to get 
<br> wayyyyy fucking darker... </p>
